## Introduction
After receiving AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification (SAA-C03) I wanted to have more practice with the services since the cloud practitioner certification is more theory. Having both theory and practice would develop me as a better Cloud Engineer.

## Instructions
To run the game, download this repository and navigate to `bin/Debug/net8.0/` and run `Hangman.exe`
